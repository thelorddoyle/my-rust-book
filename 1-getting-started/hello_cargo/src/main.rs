// cargo notes

// 1. check version with cargo --version
// 2. command to create cargo project is cargo new
// 3. command to build and obtain exec binary is cargo build
// 4. to build and run same line it is cargo run
// 5. to check it can compile but NOT create a binary executable is cargo check
// 6. if there are no changes to codebase it will not compile (cool!)
// 7. to build for release use cargo build --release
// 8. can set different compiling rules / optimisations between development and production
