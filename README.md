## Description

This is where I am storing my progress through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

At each stage I am following along with the code exercises and keeping additional notes, and where appropriate I am extending the exercises in each chapter. In this Readme I will only include the additional steps that I took at each chapter.

*Note: Some chapters are elementary or do not include exercises so are not relevant for additional exercises.* 

## Additional Exercises

- the user can set the range
- limit the game to only 3 attempts
- tell the user they can type quit to end the game
- if they write 'quit' as guess, game quits
- include input validation to ensure lower bound is lower than the upper bound
- ask the user if they want to play again after losing or winning
- correctly handle errors for input
