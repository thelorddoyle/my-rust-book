## Description

This is where I am storing my progress through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

At each stage I am following along with the code exercises and keeping additional notes, and where appropriate I am extending the exercises in each chapter. In this Readme I will only include the additional steps that I took at each chapter.

*Note: Some chapters are elementary or do not include exercises so are not relevant for additional exercises.* 

## Additional Exercises

2. Limit the game to only 3 attempts
3. Update the User Experience, so the user understands the rules

5. Include input validation to ensure lower bound is lower than the upper bound
6. Ask the user if they want to play again after losing or winning
7. Correctly handle errors for input
